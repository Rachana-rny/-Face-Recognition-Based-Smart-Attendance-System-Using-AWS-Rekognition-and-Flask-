# -Face-Recognition-Based-Smart-Attendance-System-Using-AWS-Rekognition-and-Flask-
This project is a Flask-based web application for automating attendance using face recognition. It leverages AWS Rekognition to detect and identify multiple faces from a single image and marks attendance in a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS. Student face images are stored securely in AWS S3 for future recognition.
